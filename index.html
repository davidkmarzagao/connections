        <br>
        <p>Imagine a group of robots who behave as follows…</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A robot picks a colour to display each round. <br/><br/></li>

            <li>
                It’s possible for robots to be <b>inactive</b>, where it is not 
                displaying any colour at all. But once a robot is <b>active</b>, it
                can never go back to being <b>inactive</b>. <br/><br/>
            </li>

            <li>
                Each robot picks its colour in the next round based on the proportion
                of their neighbours’ current colours. For example, the more 
                'green' neighbours a robot has, the more likely it is to pick 'green' to
                display itself in the next round. <br/><br/>
            </li>

            <li>The game ends when all robots have the same colour. This is where
                 <span style="color:#fffffe">Consensus is Reached</span><span style="color:#7f5af0">.</span><br/><br/></li>
        </ul>
        <br> 
        <p>
            We can represent this game as a graph, in which robots are nodes, and an 
            edge between them represents that they are neighbours! 

        </p>

        <h3>Starting</h3>
        <p>How to play </p>
        <br>
        <div class="container" style="justify-content: space-evenly; flex-wrap: wrap;">
            <div class="grey-small-container">
                <h1>1</h1>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    All nodes start as “inactive”, coloured grey. Two players, each with their own colour 
                    (green or purple), decide to activate a number of vertices at the start. They take turns 
                    selecting vertices by selecting “assign green node” or “assign purple node” and then 
                    selecting an “inactive” vertex from the graph that they want to be their colour.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container">
                <h1>2</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once vertices are chosen, the game begins. You can select “simulate” to see the game unfold 
                    by itself. Alternatively, you can select “iterate 1 step” to see a single round of the game play out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container">
                <h1>3</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The game may go through hundreds of iterations per run, be patient! 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container">
                <h1>4</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The game ends once all vertices are showing the same colour - this means 
                    consensus is reached and the player with that colour wins! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the start of the game, a clever you will choose vertices that are most 
                    ‘influential’. But what makes a vertex influential? 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container" style="min-height: 70px;">
                <p>
                    Is it better to be the player to make the first move or to be the second? 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container" style="min-height: 70px;">
                <p>
                    For a initial starting configuration of a graph, what is the probability 
                    that a game ends with all robots showing a particular colour, e.g. green? 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grey-small-container" style="min-height: 70px;">
                <p>Remember, although the players’ initial choice is important, there is also 
                    some randomness involved, as if the vertices were rolling a die to make decisions. </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h1> The problem of reaching</h1>
        <h1> Consensus<span style="color:#7f5af0"> …</span></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            As with the analogy with robots, consensus problems appear in several different domains. For example, 
            one may be interested in the spreading of rumours (or diseases!). Or even to study fixation of mutations 
            in a population. This problem has applications in autonomous systems that need to coordinate as a group 
            while also making decisions independently.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One can look at an example problem in consensus and wonder: which node is the most influential in a 
            given scenario? More precisely, we can define `influence' as the contribution in probability that a node 
            being, say, blue, contributes to the probability of blue consensus to take place in the entire network. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Consider a simpler version of this problem in which there are no inactive nodes. 
            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540101930883?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8b5491f4ec625e00">
            Hassin and Peleg (2001)
            </a> 
            solved the problem of determining the probability of consensus for pretty much all types of network.
             The magic in that solution is that the influence of a node does not depend on its colours nor the 
             colours of the other nodes in the network.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For situations with inactive nodes, however, that is not the case. The influence of each node does 
            change depending on the colours of the rest and whether they are active or not. Take into account a 
            drastic example in which only one node is active and the rest is inactive. In that case, the colour 
            of the active node has 100% influence on the consensus colour of the network! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Consider then a game in which 2 (or more!) players select one node each in an initially inactive network
             to turn active and to their colour.
             <span style="color:#fffffe"> Is it better to choose first or last? What are the best nodes to choose? </span>
