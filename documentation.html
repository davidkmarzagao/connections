                <p>
                    Our demo acts as a simulator to provide a dynamic and interactive platform to model the problem of 'Consensus'. 
                    Analysing how individual votes propagate and influence outcomes in a networked environment. Utilising 
                    <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a>, our tool offers users an intuitive interface to visualise and
                    explore; an invaluable resource for understanding the intricacies of network-based decision-making processes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The demo consist of a directed graph of nodes. Where through synchronous iterations, nodes can only "pull" from 
                    its target. When a node pulls from its target it will have a probability of taking the target's colour or maintain it's
                    own colour ('opinion'). However, if the target node is off, then the source node does nothing. Each node has a uniform 
                    probability of pulling from any adjacent node.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            The demo simulator can seem confusing with it's numerous different functions and buttons.
            Our goal with the simulator is to reach consensus! Whereby our simulation only exists a single
            'opinion', in other words, all nodes that are 'on' are of one colour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's go through how you can observe how different "opinions" interact! 
        </p>

            <h2>Selecting Starting nodes </h2>
            <p2>
                Before starting the simulation, first assign at least two different colours to two different nodes. 
                These colours help represent different 'opinions' within the network of nodes. There are already two 
                buttons designated for assigning two different colours: purple and green. You can also add a more colours
                to observe the effects of having 3 'opinions'.

            <h2>Iterating</h2>
            <p2>
                You can choose to iterate through the simulation manually, one iteration at
                a time with each click of a button. This allows you to observe the influence of selected 
                'opinions' at your own pace. However, if consensus is reached in one of the iterations, 
                it will not display that information to you and you can choose to continue to iterate 
                through the graph of nodes.

                You can run the simulation until consensus is reached. 
                The application will continue to automatically iterate step by step 
                until a consensus is reached.

        <div class="black-small-container">
            <h2>P-Value</h2>
            <p2>
                The p-value specifies the probability of a node doing nothing at a given iteration. For example,
                 if p = 1, for a given node, it never changes its colour. However, if p = 0, it will always pull
                 the colour from one of it's neighbour (this may include neighbours of the same colour too). 
                 Otherwise this would also mean if you set the p-value > 0, the remaining probability will be 
                 uniformly distributed to the node's adjacent nodes. So, the probability of choosing an adjacent
                 node is the same probability of choosing another adjacent node. By default, when the p-value is not set, 
                 all probabilities are uniformly distributed between the current node and all it's adjacent neighbours. 
            </p2>

            <h2>Observing Simulation History</h2>
            <p2>
                During the simulation, there is a pause button to allow you stop the simulator at a specific iteration. 
                Utilising the 'back' and 'forward' buttons, you can observe how different nodes behave over past 
                iterations. Due to the randomness of the simulation algorithm, you can not continue the simulation until
                 you are back at the specific iteration you paused at. If Consensus is reached, you can observe the simulation
                 history by clicking on the 'back' and 'forwards' buttons before resetting the demo for another simulation.
                 All without the use of the pause button.

        <p2>
            For finding the optimal solution, we will be using the number of iterations taken as out measure of time rather than the real time taken,
            as the real time taken is relative to the performance capabilities of the user hardware.
            Before trying to find the optimal solution, lets run some simulations to get an idea of the average number of iterations taken for random starting variables.
            after 100 simulations, the average number of iterations was.
